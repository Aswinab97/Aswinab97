## About Me

I'm a **Healthcare Data Analyst and AI Solutions Developer** with 2+ years of industry experience building ML pipelines, BI dashboards, and production-deployed AI tools across healthcare, finance, and the public sector.

My background spans **Mechanical Engineering → Data Science → Applied AI** — giving me a rare combination of analytical rigour, domain knowledge, and hands-on deployment skills. I'm now focused on **clinical decision support, accessibility-driven AI, and healthcare analytics** in Canada.

> 💡 I'm driven by a personal mission — using data and AI to improve healthcare accessibility for people with disabilities. This isn't just a career goal. It's personal.

## Featured Projects

### 🧠 Brain MRI Tumor Detector — Live on Azure
`PyTorch` `ResNet18` `EfficientNet` `FastAPI` `Docker` `Azure`

A production-deployed clinical web application that classifies brain MRI scans as **Tumor / No Tumor** using a deep learning ensemble — live at **Azure App Service**.

- Trained and evaluated **5 architectures**: ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2
- Built an **ensemble prediction pipeline** averaging outputs across models — improving accuracy by 2–5% over single-model inference
- Served via **FastAPI + Uvicorn**, containerized with **Docker**, deployed via **Azure Container Registry**
- Model tuned for **high recall on tumor class** — sensitivity: **95.7%**, F1: **83.0%**
- **Impact:** End-to-end medical AI system demonstrating full MLOps lifecycle — from training to cloud deployment — directly applicable to clinical diagnostic support

🌐 [Live App](https://brain-mri-analyzer-frf7ezcrc4bbafcp.eastus-01.azurewebsites.net) &nbsp;·&nbsp; 📁 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Aswinab97/brain-mri-tumor-detector)

### 🔬 Diabetes Risk Prediction — ML Classification Pipeline
`Python` `scikit-learn` `pandas` `EDA` `Jupyter Notebook`

End-to-end ML pipeline predicting diabetes risk from clinical features on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (768 patients)**.

- Performed full EDA: distribution analysis, missing value inspection, and feature correlation mapping
- Trained and benchmarked **KNN (70%), Logistic Regression (73%), and Random Forest (75%)**
- Achieved **AUC Score: 0.80** — strong class separability for a clinical screening model
- Prioritized **recall over precision** to minimize missed high-risk patients — the right clinical trade-off
- Key predictors identified: **Glucose, BMI, Age** — validated against clinical literature
- **Impact:** Reproducible, well-documented screening template applicable to early-stage disease triage in healthcare systems
