## About Me

Data Analyst with **2+ years of industry experience** building end-to-end ML pipelines, BI dashboards, and deployed AI tools that support decision-making in healthcare, finance, and the public sector.

My background bridges Mechanical Engineering, Data Science, and Applied AI — now focused on **clinical decision support, accessibility-driven AI, and healthcare analytics** in Canada.

I'm driven by a personal mission: using data and AI to improve healthcare accessibility for people with disabilities — a mission shaped by my own lived experience.
